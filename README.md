# Sleep -
Users should be able to make an account and input their sleep log. Would be cool to see a graphical log using SQL(?) to chart your process. Maybe the website could give users tips and replay ambient sounds (ie. rain, forest, white noise, etc) for them to sleep. Another feature would be to link or set up an alarm system to calculate the sleep you get, as well as how many times you hit snooze? So the final record of waking up, would be when snooze is dismissed. Later, if time, maybe refer user to products linked to sleeping better or tips or meditation guides for sleep. Would also be nice to add some nap schedule or see that displayed in google calender?

#In stock website (Similar to instock?):
Website tracks what the user preferences are. User will select items/products that will ping them or notify them when that specific item is in stock. ALso display a map of convienvt stores as to where to get them or link to the actual store website?
